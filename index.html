      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>As seen above, my name is Danielle and I'm new to coding.</p>
      <h1>I'm originally from San Diego.</h1>
      <p>I just recently moved to The Bay Area this past year.</p>
      <h1>I enjoy traveling, dancing, reading, hiking, running, and trying new restaurants.</h1>
      <p>I also play video games when I can and try to make time for reading and drawing.</p>
      <h1>My dream job right now is to be a Computational Linguist.</h1>
      <p>I studied Linguistics and Spanish during my undergrad and love learning about language.</p>
      <h1>Currently residing in Daly City.</h1>
      <p>As of now I've been to 10 countries but it's my goal to visit each continent at least once.</p>
      <h1>I'm actually taking this bootcamp to learn how to code but have always been interested in web developing. It's something that is useful in any feel and so far I like it.</h1>
      <p>I'm more interested in learing the languages of code but look forward to learning web development as a creative outlet and skill.</p>
